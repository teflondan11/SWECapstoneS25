Prog Doc #3

Recently I met up w/ my team to discuss a rough plan of what to expect and our goals. 
We first decided on a name of our website: "ReelBot" is what we decided on. 
Our next goal is to find sources and tools to help us on the project. 
We found a few youtube videos on how to build a chatbot and a fullstack app.
We discussed a rough map of what our website will have and how our users will be directed.
First will be a log in page w/ quick login from Apple, Google, and Microsoft. 
Next for new users a list of buttons that have different movie genres can pick through
After that a list of streaming services they have. 

GOALS:
Next week goals will include another meeting with the team.
We will be focusing on find more sources and conducting more research. 
Our main priority is to find a viable and update dataset that includes a ton of movies and TV-shows. 
We will finalize UI & UX design more. Our goal is to make as ergonomic and user-friendly as possible. 
Once this has been acquired we can finally start creating the project.
