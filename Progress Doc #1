Progress Doc #1

By: Daniyal Farooqui

My expirience w/ GitHub started in my junior year at Lewis when I took the OOP course, and part of the requirements for the submissions was to upload our code to GitHub and send proof through screenshots of the terminal. 
I never really got a full explanation of how GitHub works and how to work w/ partners so I really struggled using this tool. I wanted to avoid it as much as possible, but since it is an industry standard that would've been a foolish mistake.
To solve this dilemma, I watched a few Youtube tutorials and practiced a few commands. I used GitHub for my assignments in my Software Engineering course when we worked in groups. This gave me a little bit of expirience on how it works. 
Most recently, I used it for my Artifical Intelligence course for group projects as well.
